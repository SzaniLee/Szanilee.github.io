				<p>This Customer Case Management business app was created for SS' clients to make the problem reporting process easily managable. <b>Food & Employee safety incidents and equipment damage happen quite frequently in food processing plants</b> while sanitors are cleaning and sanitizing the numerous areas to prepare the facility for the following day of production. <b>This app makes it easy for yhe users to report incidents and damages in a few steps</b> that had occured in the facilities during the sanitizing shifts. Afterwards it <b>also allows an easy way of tracking the submitted cases until they are resolved on the management side of SS</b>.

					<h3 style="color: #0097F7">The Solutions</h3>
					<ul>
							<li><b>Linear step-by-step reporting process</b>: Design a linear flow since the task of creating a new case is fairly simple and easy to complete. The user can just follow a step-by-step path to accomplish his goal: “Don’t make me think, just tell me what to do next” so the task can be completed easily while-on-the-go while the user might be multi-tasking in the facility. Linear flow: Select a category (Food Safety, Employee Safety, Damage) --> Affected room/equipment/employees --> Add explanation --> Attach photos/videos --> Review --> Submit

</li>
							<li><b>Status tracker feature</b>: Categorize cases into Submitted, In-progress and Resolved statuses. Users can track the detailed progress of the cases at their own convenience if they visit the Details screen of each cases under their account.</li>
							<li><b>Progress updates in a simplified in-built messaging form per each case</b>: Since clients often have questions regarding specific cases, they have the ability to send messages or ask questions from SS's management, which reduces miscommunication and also allows the user to find out changes made by the management. This feature replaces Outlook emails and phone calls as Supervisors are hard to get in touch with those ways. </li>

							<li><b>Progress updates in a simplified in-built messaging form per each case</b>: This feature fulfills the same purpose that we designed for the client side of the app. Supervisors/Managers' notes, comments and updates are pushed into the Case Details screen so they get to communicate with the clients in a more effecient and smooth way. </li>

					<p>To be time-effecient, I quickly sketched out the main screens of the app to be able <b>to get feedback on the inital layout and overall main user flows </b>when I presented them to my team. Since we all work remotely these days due to the ongoing pandemic, I used a digital Whiteboard so I was able to share these rough sketches easily with others.</b>.</p>

				<ul class="wow slideInUp">
					<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">High-fidelity wireframes (UI design) - Client Version</h3>
					<p>Once the low-fidelity sketches were approved during further meetings scheduled with my team, we decided that I can move forward with the process and jump into designing the user interface of the app. I was applying the brand guidelines that I had estabilished previously for SS applications. I also designed additional screens to prepare for putting together a limited-functionality prototype to demonstrate the flow of the app easier for stakeholders. <b>These high-fidelity wireframes gave my team members and stakeholders the opportunity to evaluate both the functionality and the look and feel of the app</b> at the same time</b>. Below you can see the screens of the app that the <b>CLIENTS of SS</b> are interacting with.</p>
					<p>The users can easily <b>browse all their cases in a well-organized and categorized case history section</b> from where they are able to quickly check all the details of a specific case to refresh their memories and avoid confusion. They can also <b>track the status updates in the Messaging section of each cases</b> where they have the option to ask further clarifications from Supervisors or answer any questions. <b>Creating a new report takes them to a linear 4-step guided process</b> where they can quickly let the Supervisors know about what happened and why they need help to address the issue. The ability to add photos and videos make the identification and risk assessment process quicker on the management side and records proof for any potential liabiltity issues.</p>

					<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">High-fidelity wireframes (UI Design) - Management Version</h3>
					<p>As for <b>the Management version of the app</b>, I kept the base of the user interface of the client view, however <b>adjusted the design based on the different needs</b> and goals of the Supervisors. Their main need is to be able <b>to quickly have an overview of all the reported cases and then be able to change the status of cases easily with a few simple steps</b>. Changing the status is a linear flow as a Submitted case can only be changed into In-progress status while the supervisor is working on a case and then close it as Resolved when the problem was successfully solved.</b> Once a case has an updated status, the submitter <b>gets notified of it within the app</b> on the Case Details screen, which also allows the Supervisors to <b>write comments and leave messages or updates regarding a case on the details screen</b> so the communication is more efficient and organized this way! The <b>filter on the case history screen</b> gives the users the freedom to narrows down the list of case status categories that satisfies their specified criteria.
