					<p>Entering the design environment at Moneybowl, I found myself facing a black hole of information. The lack of clear guidelines and structure left the design landscape chaotic.It felt like exploring space without a navigation system. Inconsistent designs were scattered around like debris, while accessibility issues loomed large, hindering visually impaired users from accessing the app.

</span></p>
					<p>

A major redesign and the addition of new features within three months added a sense of urgency to our mission. It was as if we needed to find solutions with the swiftness of a shooting star. The challenge was not just to fix the existing problems, but <span class="lighthighlight">to create a cohesive universe where design and development could coexist harmoniously.</span>

					<div><p>It became clear that collaborative meetings alone couldn't bridge the gap between designers and developers. It was time to take a bold step and <span class="lighthighlight">initiate the creation of a design system.</span> </p>
						<p>Inspired by how astronauts plan their missions meticulously, I began breaking down our existing design elements. My goal? To build a framework that would lead us to better designs. As the lead designer on this project, I took on the roles of teacher and visionary. I entrusted a junior designer with refining text and color guidelines, encouraging teamwork and learning along the way.</p>
						<p>The creation of the design system wasn't just about structure, it was about building a shared universe where both designers and developers could thrive. <span class="lighthighlight">I set out to rebuild all elements using auto layout and constraints. It was a task that required careful attention and precision, much like assembling a spacecraft before a voyage into the unknown.</span> I aimed for every pixel, every interaction, to align perfectly, just like stars coming together to create constellations in the night sky.</p>
						<p>Just as an astronaut equips their spacecraft with essential tools, I equipped our team with these components and guides, ensuring that each element could be reused throughout the application's user interface. This was my contribution as the lead designer on the design system:<span class="lighthighlight">to provide a roadmap to make sure our team had everything they needed for success and a speedy delivery. </p>
						<p>The responsibilities were weighty, but the reward was seeing chaos evolve into order, as the UI transformed into a harmonious symphony of design elements.</p>

					<div><p>As our journey continued, a new obstacle surfaced: accessibility issues. I recognized that addressing these challenges was much like taking off on a mission to bridge the gap between distant planets. Collaborating closely with the iOS and Android development teams, we faced this new challenge with determination and stayed focused to find solutions.<p>
<p>As the leader of this mission, my goal was to ensure visually impaired users could easily use the app.
	<p>On the iOS front, the journey began by understanding <span class="lighthighlight">Apple's Dynamic Type feature</span>. This ingenious system allows users to adjust the font size system-wide according to their preference. In case of <span class="lighthighlight">Android, Sp (scaled pixels) and Dp (density-independent pixels) units</span> are the building blocks of responsive design. By integrating these features, <span class="lighthighlight">the application's fonts responded dynamically to users' settings, ensuring readability and user comfort.</span></p>

	<p>However, our pursuit of accessibility extended beyond responsive font scaling. Collaboratively, we identified the <span class="lighthighlight">thresholds for both iOS & Android where layout adjustments should be triggered for accessibility</span>, rather than dynamic changes. This approach ensured that users who required larger fonts experienced a truly optimized layout, enhancing both legibility and usability.


	<p>My approach included designing several screens that catered specifically to accessible font settings. By anticipating and accommodating the needs of users who preferred larger fonts, I created a suite of screens that seamlessly transitioned into a more accessible layout. <span class="lighthighlight">This proactive strategy meant that the application wasn't just dynamically responsive; it was intentionally accessible.</span></p>

						<p>Our team, led by my efforts, successfully met the demanding three-month deadline, delivering the major redesign and implementing new features.
