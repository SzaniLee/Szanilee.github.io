					<p>Entering the design environment at Moneybowl, I found myself facing a black hole of information. The lack of guidelines and structure left the design landscape in disarray, similarly to the aftermath of a comet's passage through the solar system. <span class="lighthighlight">Inconsistent designs appeared like scattered asteroids, and accessibility issues loomed like a dark nebula, excluding visually impaired users from the application's reach.</span></p>
					<p>

A major redesign and the addition of new features within three months added a sense of urgency to our mission. It was as if we needed to find solutions with the swiftness of a shooting star. The challenge was not just to fix the existing problems, but <span class="lighthighlight">to create a cohesive universe where design and development could coexist harmoniously.</span>

					<div><p>In the middle of the cosmic challenges that engulfed the Moneybowl design environment, it became clear that collaborative meetings alone couldn't bridge the gap between designers and developers. It was time to take a bold step and <span class="lighthighlight">initiate the creation of a design system—</span> a hope of order in the midst of cosmic chaos. </p>
						<p>Drawing inspiration from the meticulous planning of astronauts embarking on a mission, I initiated the deconstruction of the existing UI elements. My aim was to forge a unified framework that would light the path to design excellence. As the lead designer on the design system, I embraced the dual role of mentor and visionary. I entrusted a junior designer with refining text and color guidelines, fostering collaboration and growth within our cosmic design journey.</p>
						<p>The creation of the design system wasn't just about structure, it was about building a shared universe where both designers and developers could thrive. <span class="lighthighlight">I set out to rebuild all elements using auto layout and constraints—a task that required careful attention and precision, much like assembling a spacecraft before a voyage into the unknown.</span> I wanted every pixel, every interaction, to be in perfect alignment, much like stars forming constellations in the night sky.</p>
						<p>Just as an astronaut equips their spacecraft with essential tools, I equipped our team with these components, ensuring that each element could be reused throughout the application. This was my contribution as the lead designer —<span class="lighthighlight">to provide a roadmap through the cosmos of design challenges and empower our team with the tools</span> they needed to succeed.</p>
						<p>I oversaw the <span class="lighthighlight">integration of components,</span> much like an astronaut guiding a spacecraft through treacherous terrain. The responsibilities were weighty, but the reward was seeing chaos evolve into cosmos, as the UI transformed into a harmonious symphony of design elements.</p>

					<div><p>As our journey through the cosmos of design challenges continued, a new frontier emerged—a daunting expanse of accessibility issues. I recognized that addressing these challenges was much like taking off on a mission to bridge the gap between distant planets. Collaborating closely with the iOS and Android development teams, we navigated this uncharted territory with determination and resolve.<p>
<p>As the leader of this mission, I took the lead to steer our efforts in the right direction, ensuring that visually impaired users would find a welcoming path through the application's universe.
	<p>On the iOS front, the journey began by understanding <span class="lighthighlight">Apple's Dynamic Type feature</span>. This ingenious system allows users to adjust the font size system-wide according to their preference. In case of <span class="lighthighlight">Android, Sp (scaled pixels) and Dp (density-independent pixels) units</span> are the building blocks of responsive design. By integrating these features, <span class="lighthighlight">the application's fonts responded dynamically to users' settings, ensuring readability and user comfort.</span></p>

	<p>However, our pursuit of accessibility extended beyond responsive font scaling. Collaboratively, we identified the <span class="lighthighlight">thresholds for both iOS & Android where layout adjustments should be triggered for accessibility</span>, rather than dynamic changes. This approach ensured that users who required larger fonts experienced a truly optimized layout, enhancing both legibility and usability.


	<p>My approach included designing several screens that catered specifically to accessible font settings. By anticipating and accommodating the needs of users who preferred larger fonts, I created a suite of screens that seamlessly transitioned into a more accessible layout. <span class="lighthighlight">This proactive strategy meant that the application wasn't just dynamically responsive; it was intentionally accessible.</span></p>

						<p>With the swiftness of a meteor shower, we managed to meet the demanding three-month deadline, delivering the major redesign and new features.

								<p>
In closing, our journey has been a cosmic ballet - a dance of creativity, problem-solving, and the forging of connections. As we conclude this case study, we launch ourselves into the ever-expanding universe of design, armed with the knowledge that chaos can be transformed into constellations, and that collaboration is the fuel that propels us beyond the stars. Our story remains an inspiration, a reminder that with determination and unity, we can shape not only designs but the world around us, one pixel at a time.</b>
