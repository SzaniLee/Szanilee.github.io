					<h2>Chapter 1:<span class="highlight">Morning clarity</span></h2> 
					<p>It was the onset of a new month and a new project. Sitting in my home office, coffee in hand, I opened up my laptop and dove into the GEMS project. 



With every sip of my morning brew, I became more immersed in the feedback from the Sales Ops users of the old GEMS that was built in Dynamics 365. They felt lost in a system they should have easily navigated, struggling to manage user roles and permissions effectively.</p>

<p>I thought, “This isn’t just about tweaking a few buttons. This is about rethinking the whole user experience.” The GEMS system was ripe for change. </p>

<h6 style="text-decoration: bold;"><span class="lighthighlight">The central question emerged:</span></h6>

<blockquote class="quote2">How might we implement a user roles and permissions system in the new GEMS product to let Sales Ops users efficiently manage user creation, record handling, role assignment, and permissions, all while keeping the experience intuitive?</blockquote>		
	</div>

				<div class="designmargin">
				<ul class="wow slideInUp">
	
					
					<h6 style="text-decoration: bold;">The <span class="lighthighlight">objectives</span> became clear:</h6>
					
				<ul>
					<li>Streamline user creation, record management, role assignment, and permissions.</li>
					<li>Ensure that users have role-based access to screens, enhancing security and efficiency.</li>
					

</ul>
				
					<h6 style="text-decoration: bold;">To measure the success, I needed to keep in mind these two main <span class="lighthighlight">metrics:</span></h6>
					
		
				<ul>
					<li>A boost in user satisfaction, particularly in their interactions with the user and role management features.</li>
					<li>A significant increase in the percentage of users with the correct system access.
</li>

					<li><span class="lighthighlight">User editing interface:</span> We envisioned an interface that not only allows editing of user records but would do so with simplicity and speed. Any modification, from basic details to role reassignment, should be a few clicks away.</li>
					<li><span class="lighthighlight">User activation/deactivation:</span> Implement a feature that allows Sales Ops users to activate or deactivate user accounts. Deactivation should disable access while preserving historical data.</li>				
					<li><span class="lighthighlight">User listing, search and filtering:</span> Sales Ops users should be armed with a user list that was not static but dynamic, offering sorting and filtering options to quickly pinpoint users based on various attributes, such as location (sales region, sales territories, regions, district, center)</li>
					<li><span class="lighthighlight">Roles assignment on user profile:</span> Develop a feature for assigning roles to a given user. With a clear list of available roles and a quick overview of assigned roles, Sales Ops users could save time, reduce errors, enhance control, improve the user experience, and boost overall productivity.

					<li><span class="lighthighlight">Role editing and deletion:</span> Needed an interface that not only facilitated the editing of role details but also ensured the deletion process was secure, calling to user's attention the consquences of it.</li>
					<li><span class="lighthighlight">Permission assignment:</span> Design an interface that enables a precise and clear mapping of permissions to specific roles, assuring users were granted access tailored to their specific needs and no more. This should include a clear list of available permissions and an overview of assigned ones.</li>				
					<li><span class="lighthighlight">Permission deletion:</span> Enable Sales Ops users to remove permissions from roles if they are no longer needed, ensuring role definitions remained relevant and apt.</li>
					<li><span class="lighthighlight">Roles listing, filtering & search:</span> Develop a roles list view with sorting, searching and filtering options based on permission attributes (service, action, scope, perspective).

								<h1>Reflection</h1>
								<p>
As I look back at the journey of transforming GEMS, I'm reminded of the power of empathy, innovation, and collaboration. It all began with a simple cup of morning coffee and a challenge: How can we make GEMS more intuitive and user-friendly for Sales Ops users, shifting it from its legacy Dynamics 365 experience into a completely new and refreshing product?</p>

<p>Throughout this adventure, each chapter unfolded like a new day, revealing fresh insights and solutions. From ideation to wireframing, and from user flows to high-fidelity design, my team and I shaped GEMS to align seamlessly with the needs of our users.</p></b>
