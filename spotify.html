						<p>Once I outlined my research plan, I conducted a quick market research to gather information about Spotify, the music streaming industry itself and Spotify's position in the industry. I concluded that Spotify has a broad audience, however the age range of the target audience falls between 18-34 years. It's important to note that Spotify used to have an inbox feature but it removed the messaging capabilities in 2017 due to low engagement. These important insights made me <b>focus on thinking about future social features that would generate high engagement by  users and are user-specific</b> as those features seem to be popular among Spotify users according to my research. <p>

					<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Competitive Analysis</h3>
					<p>Spotify is the leader in the music streaming industry so I decided to <b>analyze how Spotify might distinguish itself from its competitiors</b>. Through my analysis, I was pointing out the strengths and weaknesses of the competitor music streaming services, which were Apple Music, Pandora, Soundcloud and Amazon Music. I compared them to Spotify based on some certain additional factors: monthly unique users in the US, subscription price, music library size, platforms, strengths and weaknesses.</p>

I analyzed the latest version of the mobile app's premium version by taking screenshots of main screens and explaining the purpose of each screens with annotations to important features. I was able to identify the design patterns of Spotify that allowed me to integrate the new features seamlessly.

I held two rounds of brainstorming ideas, each consisted of 5 minutes brainstorming / HMW questions that I presented to the participants after another.

					<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Information Architecture: Sitemap</h3>
					<p>Moving forward, I built the sitemap of the app <b>to show where the new features will be integrated into the existing app</b>. 
						<p>At first I was planning to add the <b>Friends Feed feature</b> to the navigation bar as it serves as the main new feature that increases social activity. However since Spotify has recently simplified the bottom bar by removing multiple navigation items, I decided to integrate the Friends Feed into the search screen. This feature <b>allows users to discover new music through friends' activity history or posts</b>.</p>
						<p>As for the <b>Check In Mood feature</b>, the potential best placement for it would be on the Search screen as well as this feature functions more like a new search method. By utilizing the Mood search feature, users can <b>search for curated playlists based on their moods</b> which satisfies both a user goal and need. </p>

				<ul class="wow slideInUp">
					<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">User Flow</h3>
					<p>I created a User Flow diagram to visualize how Jeremy would <b>navigate through the app using the new features</b>. 

						<p>The first scenario focuses on the Mood feature that satisfies Jeremy's need of <b>finding playlists efficiently that match his current mood</b> and meets his goal of <b>listening to enjoyable, already curated playlists</b>. The second scenario allows Jeremy to <b>discover new songs through friends and connect with others through music</b> which are important goals of his. By using the new <b>Friend Feed feature</b>, he's also able to meet some of his needs:expressing his thoughts about music he shares and knowing what his social circle is listening to.

	<div class="market">
			<ul class="wow slideInUp">
					<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Task Flow</h3>
					<p>Then I created a few Task flows to map out the user journey for <b>multiple single key tasks which are going to be completed a very similar way by the majority of users</b>. These additional singular task flows helped me better understand what steps users take in order to achieve their goals so I identified additional UI elements that I needed to design alongside the new features for the perfect flows.

					<p>After I have identified the key screens that were needed to be designed in order to help Jeremy achieve his goals and tasks successfully by using the new features that I was planning to integrate into the app, <b>I sketched out the layout and placement of the new features before going digital</b>. These are the low-cost low-fidelity wireframe sketches with annotations to explain certain elements. </p>

					<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">High-fidelity wireframes</h3>
					<p>By relying on the low-fidelity sketches, I designed the high-fidelity wireframes in Figma. I <b>recreated the existing UI of Spotify</b> as pixel-perfect as I was able to and I <b>implemented the new features</b> into the screens while making sure that I'm using already existing design patterns within the app and I tried not to introduce new patterns - only if it was necessary. These high-fidelity wireframes demonstrate the look and feel of the app with the new features integrated into the UI. I also <b>created new playlist covers</b> - based on existing album designs - for the homescreen's From Your Community's & For Your Frequent mood's playlists as they are additional parts of the new main features.

								<h1>Reflection</h1>
								<p>This project was quite challenging for me and in the beginning I found it difficult to integrate new features by not introducing any new design patterns. I had quite a different vision of the look and feel of the new features until I got to the step of designing the high-fidelity wireframes where I realized that it was a must to follow Spotify's existing patterns in order to successully blend the new features into the UI. However I could overcome this major challenge by analyzing the current app in depth so I could use some of its UI elements as references that I could apply to the new features.</p>

								<li>More rounds of usability testings to keep making improvements.</li>
								<li>Track the engagement of the new features.</li>
