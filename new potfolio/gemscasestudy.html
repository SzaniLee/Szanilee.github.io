					<h2>Chapter 1:<span class="highlight">Morning clarity</span></h2> 
					<p>It was the onset of a new month and a new project. Sitting in my home office, coffee in hand, I opened up my laptop and dove into the GEMS project. 



With every sip of my morning brew, I became more immersed in the feedback from the Sales Ops users of the old GEMS that was built in Dynamics 365. They felt lost in a system they should have easily navigated, struggling to manage user roles and permissions effectively.</p>

<p>I thought, “This isn’t just about tweaking a few buttons. This is about rethinking the whole user experience.” The GEMS system was ripe for change. </p>

<h6 style="text-decoration: bold;"><span class="lighthighlight">The central question emerged:</span></h6>

<blockquote class="quote2">How might we implement a user roles and permissions system in the new GEMS product to let Sales Ops users efficiently manage user creation, record handling, role assignment, and permissions, all while keeping the experience intuitive?</blockquote>

					<h6 style="text-decoration: bold;">The <span class="lighthighlight">objectives</span>became clear:</h6>
					
				<ul>
					<li>Streamline user creation, record management, role assignment, and permissions.</li>
					<li>Ensure that users have role-based access to screens, enhancing security and efficiency.</li>
					

</ul>
				
					<h6 style="text-decoration: bold;">To measure the success,I needed to keep in mind these two main <span class="lighthighlight">metrics:</span></h6>
					
		
				<ul>
					<li>A boost in user satisfaction, particularly in their interactions with the user and role management features.</li>
					<li>A significant increase in the percentage of users with the correct system access.

					<p>Another morning, another challenge. In my cozy home office, where inspiration thrives, I wrapped myself in the warmth of a soft blanket as our team embarked on another virtual journey. Through the lens of Zoom, Miro, and FigJam, I dove headfirst into a <span class="lighthighlight">whiteboarding exercise</span> with the Product Owner. Thanks to her great experience with UX Stategy, this collaboration session once again felt like a breeze.

					<li><span class="lighthighlight">User editing interface:</span> We envisioned an interface that not only allows editing of user records but would do so with simplicity and speed. Any modification, from basic details to role reassignment, should be a few clicks away.</li>
					<li><span class="lighthighlight">User activation/deactivation:</span> Implement a feature that allows Sales Ops users to activate or deactivate user accounts. Deactivation should disable access while preserving historical data.</li>				
					<li><span class="lighthighlight">User listing, search and filtering:</span> Sales Ops users should be armed with a user list that was not static but dynamic, offering sorting and filtering options to quickly pinpoint users based on various attributes, such as location (sales region, sales territories, regions, district, center)</li>
					<li><span class="lighthighlight">Roles assignment on user profile:</span> Develop a feature for assigning roles to a given user. With a clear list of available roles and a quick overview of assigned roles, Sales Ops users could save time, reduce errors, enhance control, improve the user experience, and boost overall productivity.

					<li><span class="lighthighlight">Permission deletion:</span> Enable Sales Ops users to remove permissions from roles if they are no longer needed, ensuring role definitions remained relevant and apt.</li>
					<li><span class="lighthighlight">Roles listing, filtering & search:</span> Develop a roles list view with sorting, searching and filtering options based on permission attributes (service, action, scope, perspective).

Automating user record population from Active Directory would benefit Sales Ops users by saving time and ensuring data accuracy.</li>
					<li><span class="lighthighlight">Role synchronization:</span> Through automating the synchronization of user roles with the changes occurring in JDE, GEMS would automatically update user roles whenever there were promotions, demotions, or exits, maintaining a reliable reflection of the actual organizational structure and user statuses.</li>
					<li><span class="lighthighlight">Role-based user lists:</span> Create a feature that displays a list of all users associated with a specific role, making it easy for Sales Ops users to review and manage user-role assignments.</li>

					<div><p>In the design phase, my role centered on the art of translating the imaginative solutions into interfaces that captivated the eye and embraced users with friendliness. I shouldered the responsibility of ensuring that the final design didn't merely check functional boxes but seamlessly melded with the product's established design identity and brand essence. This comprehensive approach formed the cornerstone of my mission to craft a visually cohesive and user-centric journey within GEMS.</p>

					<h3 style="text-decoration: bold;">Perfecting the blueprint: High-fidelity wireframing and iteration</h3>
				
				
					<p>Relying on the user flows as my guiding framework, I dived into designing the high-fidelity wireframes in Figma. Each wireframe felt like an idea coming to life, a significant step closer to our final product.</p>

					<p>I initiated <span class="lighthighlight">design reviews with our Product Owner (PO)</span> to ensure the designs aligned with our goals and met user needs. Her insights were invaluable, helping me refine the wireframes further.</p>

					<p>Following that, I facilitated <span class="lighthighlight">design reviews with our dedicated development team</span> to ensure the designs were not only visually compelling but also feasible and efficient to implement.</p>

					<p>Throughout this iterative journey, I engaged in constant <span class="lighthighlight">feedback sessions</span>, actively listening to suggestions and making necessary adjustments and enhancements. This collaborative approach allowed me to fine-tune our design dynamically in response to real-world considerations.

Drawing from our design system was key to achieving this goal.</p>


					<p>If you're curious to learn more about the design system that shapes GEMS, I invite you to explore the design system case study. It's a valuable resource that reveals how I built a design system from the ground up and integrated it into the GEMS project. It shows how this framework brings consistency and purpose to GEMS, offering a behind-the-scenes look at its visual identity and consistency. <a href="https://www.szanilee.com/designsystem.html" target="_blank" style="color:#16152b;"><span class="highlight">Check the design system case study related to GEMS.</a></span> </p>

	

					<p>By adhering to the principles and patterns set within this phase, <span class="lighthighlight">I established design standards that would serve as a blueprint for the rest of the product.</span> This consistency in design ensured that as GEMS expanded and evolved, it would continue to provide users with a familiar and intuitive experience, setting the stage for a successful and user-centric product journey.

</p>

<p>Before this hand-off could take place, a critical step had been accomplished: the design had undergone a thorough <span class="lighthighlight">sign-off process</span>. This sign-off was similar to giving a green light, indicating that the design was well-prepared, thoroughly reviewed, aligned with our project's goals and user needs.</p>

<p>To ensure a smooth transition from design to development, <span class="lighthighlight">I created a separate development file</span>. This file, once handed over, was meant to remain unchanged, preserving the original design.

								<h1>Reflection</h1>
								<p>
As I look back at the journey of transforming GEMS, I'm reminded of the power of empathy, innovation, and collaboration. It all began with a simple cup of morning coffee and a challenge: How can we make GEMS more intuitive and user-friendly for Sales Ops users, shifting it from its legacy Dynamics 365 experience into a completely new and refreshing product?</p>

<p>Throughout this adventure, each chapter unfolded like a new day, revealing fresh insights and solutions. From ideation to wireframing, and from user flows to high-fidelity design, my team and I shaped GEMS to align seamlessly with the needs of our users.</p></b>
