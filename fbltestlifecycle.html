				<p>Feedback Loop is an agile research platform for rapid consumer feedback that helps businesses collecting data from real consumers to make sure that a product is a hit. During this project I, as a UX Designer, collaborated with a Product Manager, Developers and our UX Researcher to reimagine the launch / queue test experience staying aligned with the entire flow of the test lifecycle from draft state → submitted OR in-progress → completed. In this portfolio piece, we will be focusing on the new ‘launch test’ flow and how the solutions to previously existing user pain points improved the entire user experience leading to user satisfaction.</b>.

					<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">OLD DESIGN & FLOW</h3>
					<p>In the old version, when users had created a new test and were ready to submit it to start collecting responses, once they clicked on ‘Add to queue’ main button on the test creation page, users experienced friction and frustration. It was unclear for them what happens upon clicking on ‘Add to queue’, not knowing what that action results in nor were given information on what they should do next once they had clicked on it. The only system feedback the user received was the update of the status labels under the test title field. The status pillar either changed to 'submitted' or 'in-progress', but users didn't understand the difference between the statuses, the reason behind why tests change into 'in-progress' or 'submitted' and they neither understood what they should expect next.</b></p>

				<ul class="wow slideInUp">
					<h3 style="color: #ed2626", style="text-decoration: underline;">MAIN USER PAIN POINTS</h3>
					<ul>
					<li>before clicking on ‘Add to queue’, users had no idea about whether the test was going to launch (draft →  in-progress ) or be added to a queue ( draft → submitted ) where tests were waiting to be launched. It always caught them by surprise as no warnings or context were provided for them beforehand</li>
					<li>not knowing what they should do next after a test had launched and neither knew what to do once it was submitted to the queue</li>
					<li>not knowing when a  test in queue would be launched (move from submitted  → in-progress )</li>
					<li>not knowing when a test would complete once it was launched ( in-progress → completed )</li>
				</ul>


<p></p>

					<p>These core problems made it impossible for the majority of users to understand and track the happenings to their tests. Users also found it difficult to estimate when they will be able to see results - possibly missing some deadlines due to it. </p>

				<ul class="wow slideInUp">
					<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">TECHNICAL BACKGROUND </h3>
					<p>We needed to take into consideration some technical requirements and development aspects. Whether a test launches automatically or is added to the queue once a user clicks on “Add to queue’, depends on the user’s org capacity:</b></p>
					<ul>
					<li>if a workspace has an open capacity then the test would automatically launch and the status of the test would be updated: draft → in-progress</li>
					<li>if a workspace does not have an open capacity then the test would not be able to launch immediately and would be added to a queue where it will wait until there is open capacity for it to launch at some point (draft → submitted)</li></ul>
					
					<p></p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Tests automatically complete maximum within 48 hours, sourcing efforts should end & results should be out for users to analyze.</p>	
					<p><i>Note: Org capacity means number of available spots for tests to be launched in a timeframe. Each organization has a limited amount of tests available for them to launch and run in the same time and once that capacity is reached, they can’t launch tests right away and the tests have to wait in a “submitted section’ until a spot frees up among the ‘in-progress’ section</i></p>	
					
				</ul>

<div class="market">
				
				<ul class="wow slideInUp">
					<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">MVP SUCCESS CRITERIA</h3>
					
					<ul>
					<li>After filling out the required field on tests draft page, users know exactly how to [launch test ] or [ add test to queue ]</li>
					<li>After clicking [CTA], user know what will happen next</li>
					<li>After completing experience, users should feel informed</li></ul>

					<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">IDEATING</h3>
					<p>At first since this was my first complex project working at FBL, I needed to gather as much information as possible to fully understand the core problems to be able to propose the best solutions. I set up calls with our UX Researcher to go over a high-level competitor analysis with her to see how other platforms handle the ‘launch test’ experience. We also had a quick brainstorming session together where we came to the conclusion that the <b>‘Add to queue’ button copy itself is causing major confusion in users as it’s not reflecting the actual user action and outcome</b>. </p>	
					<p>‘Add to queue’ button copy is misleading as a test can either go to queue or be launched right away so the copy sets the wrong expectations for users. Many users launched the test by mistake as they thought it will be ‘saved’ in the queue so they have a chance to edit them before it launches. Therefore, users were really frustrated when they realized that some tests launched right away as they couldn't 'undo' it. They didn’t have the option to recover from those mistakes as a ‘cancel test’ functionality doesn’t exist in the platform as of today still so it was crucial to communicate the consequences of clicking on ‘Add to queue’ button.</p>
				</ul>
			</div>
		<div class="market">

				<ul class="wow slideInUp">
					<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">FLOWS + SKETCHES</h3>
					<p>Based on the specs and conversations that I had with several people from the company and team, I started to map out a few potential flows and sketch out some inital design proposals. The goal was to provide valuable information to users upfront and during the experience as I sort of walk users through the steps. It was important to make users understand what is going to happen in the upcoming 48 hours to their test (the maximum amount of hours a test must end up ‘completed’.) </p>
					<p>To understand better how a user will go through this experience, I created a user flow with key actions, decision points and pages involved. </p>
						<img class="image-empathy img-responsive" src="img/launchflow.svg" class="center"></a>
	<ul class="wow slideInUp">
					<p> The user flow helped me making some decisions about the design when I started to sketch my initial layouts out. I thought a two step modal flow could be ideal to address major pain points and design with the whole org capacity technical considerations. A first modal could have the purpose of informing users about what WILL HAPPEN to their test and what this action will result in if they proceed to launch or submitting to queue. A second modal could have the purpose of confirming what HAD HAPPENED to the test and providing next steps or adding further information related to the current status of the test. </p>

					<p>I prepared another design where the indication of whether a test can launch or will be added to the queue is visible upfront before the user clicks on 'Launch test' button. I proposed this solution to the team because in case they thought a two-step modal experience was potentially causing modal fatigue for users, this could be a good starting point to think about how we can elimante the first modal and keep the confirmation one only. 

					<p>After discussing the options with the team, we decided that we will move forward with the two-step modal experience as it's easier to present crucial information for users within the modal. On the page the amount of information could have increased cognitive load for users.

				<ul class="wow slideInUp">
					<h3 style="color: #19967d" style="text-decoration: underline;">SOLUTIONS I PROPOSED TO THE TEAM</h3>
					<ul>
					<li>Rename ‘Add to queue’ button to “Launch test” to better reflect user action and to set the right expectations</li>
					<li>Visually indicate how a test status changes: draft → in progress, draft → submitted, draft → in progress, in-progress → completed</li>
					<li>Pop-up modal flow to help users focus and keep their attention to consume crucial information regarding their test</li>
					<li>First modal: purpose of informing users about what WILL HAPPEN to their test  |  Second modal: confirming what HAD HAPPENED to the test and providing next steps</li>
					<li>To communicate with a banner why a test can launch right away OR why it can only be added to the queue (org capacity indication)</li>
					<li>To present content in an easily scannable way so users don’t feel burdened by the amount of information - using bulletpoints to highlight key steps</li>
					<li>Add Estimated turnaround time + position in queue sections </li>

							<li>rephrase "position in queue:4" to “# of tests ahead in the queue” to clarify the position of the test.</li>
							<li>add a "View in queue" main cta in the second "Submitted to queue" modal. Users expected to be able to check their test in the queue on the workspace page so we can easily guide them there.</li>

								<h1>Reflection</h1>
								<p>This project had complex problems yet we were able to ship a simple solution to them. User flows and the usability testing provided the biggest help during this project that lead to the overall success of the new launch / queueing test experience. Being able to test with users before shipping provided enourmous value and it allowed me to make last minute changes that improves the UX holistically. The progress bar, the simplicity of the content in the modals and the entire flow is loved by users ever since it went live. We actually conducted an E2E usability testing on the whole product in December 2021 and it once again proved how satisfied users were and are with this improvement made back in the summer of 2021.</b>
