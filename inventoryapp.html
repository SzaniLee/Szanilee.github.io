				<p>This Inventory Ordering Business App <b>was created to reimagine the entire ordering process</b> within the company, which is now quicker and more efficient <b>for the employees</b> of Service Management System's two divisions (Sanitation Specialists & Innovative Cleaning Solutions). By creating this app, <b>we were able to speed up the workflow of the AP & Purchasing Supervisor as well</b>, who eventually handles the incoming order requests on the backside of the app and sends the requests to vendors upon the approval of managers & supervisors. <b>The app makes it easy for the user to track the progress of all of their orders</b> by being updated whenever the status of the orders has changed. The data is connected to the company's CRM platform (Dynamics 365).

					<p><b>Since the business app needed to be designed and shipped urgently</b>, I had to challenge myself to design an app without applying my usual lenghty primary research methods. Instead, I was required to create the app based on a couple of stakeholder meetings and brief discussions with future users. <b>When all the problems were identified and concluded based on the notes taken, potential solutions were brainstormed and are listed below:</b>.  </p>
						
					
					<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">THE PROBLEMS</h3>
					
				<ul>
					<li><b>Paper forms of the Inventory Ordering documents are time-consuming to fill out</b></li>
					<li><b>Complicated inventory ordering process:</b> Employees send in their list of needed items through a paper document that they have to print out, fill out, take a photo of and attach the photos in email then finally send it to the AP & Purchasing Supervisor</li>
					<li><b>Lengthy lists with hundreds of different kind of items seem to be time-consuming to select from when ordering on paper</b>: Employees need to checkmark the items they need to order but since it is on paper, they have to look for each item manually </li>
					<li><b>AP & Purchasing Supervisor is overwhelmed with a massive amount of incoming emails</b> sent by several employees on a daily level who wish to order certain items for the selected clients</b></li>
					<li>Inventory Ordering documents are <b>unorganized in the Mailboxes</b> </li>
					<li><b>Unable to keep track of previous or current orders easily and efficiently</b></li>
				</p>	</ul>

				<ul class="wow slideInUp">
					<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">THE SOLUTIONS</h3>
					<ul>
					<li><b>Replacing the Inventory Ordering form document with a digital mobile application offering a simplified ordering flow </b></li>
					<li><b>E-commerce style app</b>: Ability to look up the available categorized product catalogs of each companies (clients) and the items can be quickly browsed, searched for and added to cart for order.</li>
					<li><b>Connect the app’s data and the incoming order requests to the company’s CRM platform</b> (Dynamics 365) through where the AP & Purchasing Supervisor is able to handle the orders instead of receiving them in his Outlook inbox
</b></li>
					<li>Ability to <b>track all the orders</b> created by each users </li>
					<li><b>Status feature:</b> Lets the user follow the progress of the created order request that needs to be viewed and approved by Managers or Supervisors before get sent to the purchasing department </b></li>

					<li>I was also <b>referring to the Inventory Ordering paper document that all the employees were using</b> at that point when they wanted to submit a new order to the purchasing department..</li>
					<li><b>I scheduled a meeting with my team</b> to propose my e-commerce style app idea and direction to discuss and <b>receive valuable feedback</b> on it.
</b></li>
					<li>After some initial discussions <b>I got the green light to move forward with the idea and the direction</b> so I was ready to dive myself into the <b>high-fidelity wireframes</b> as we had a very limited time to ship the product. </li>

				<div class="designmargin">
				<ul class="wow slideInUp">
					<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">High-fidelity wireframes</h3>
					<p>Based on the low-fidelity sketches, I started to design the high-fidelity wireframes. I have estabilished the branding of the company prior to this project so had to make sure to design the user interface according to the branding guidelines. While I was working on the wireframes, I had to keep in mind that Microsoft Power Apps has technical limitations so I needed to keep the design as simple as possible. I was required to place all visual elements and the required content to a fixed screen size that is default in Power Apps so the users don't have the option to scroll up and down on any screens - except the product catalog screen. It was definitely challenging but I have overcome the barriers rapidly.

								<h1>Reflection</h1>
								<p>This project seemed to be challenging because it required lots of rapid thinking - such as identifying the problems and coming up with solutions in such a short amount of time as the app had to be designed urgently. Another challenge I faced was that I needed to design the app and ensure a seemless user flow relying on a paper document and a couple of stakeholder discussions. However I knew that if I merge my ideas with the paper document that the users are already familiar with, I can design an app that satisfies both the user and business goals. Another difficulty was that Power Apps had such tehcnical limitations at the time that I was requested to design the majority of screens not-scrollable where it was possible. It was tough because there are so many elements that are necessary for certain screens and as a UC deigner I had to avoid the possibilities of potential fat-finger errors occuring. I am proud to say that I tackled the issue and the users have not complained about mistapping on elements and they have been using the app ever since May, 2020! (and now it is already November 13,2020)
