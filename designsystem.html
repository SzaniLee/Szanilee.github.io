				<h3 style="text-decoration: bold;">Background</h3>	 		
				<p>The project revolved around the set-up of a design system specifically tailored for an internal management tool at Bowlero Corp., aimed at supporting their day-to-day operations.
					<p>

				However, the scope of the design system extended beyond just the current management tool. It was designed to be a universal framework that would not only support the existing product (referred to as GEMS) but also serve as a foundation for future internal products developed within Bowlero Corp. This approach ensured consistency and synergy across various tools and applications, enhancing the overall usability and brand identity.
</p>
<p><u>Note:</u> This case study covers the The project is ongoing at the time of writing and regularly maintained in a living Figma file, where continuous updates are incorporated. However, these subsequent updates won't be reflected in this case study.</p>

				<h3 style="text-decoration: bold;">The Challenges</h3>	 		
				<p>
				<ul>
					<li><u>Pre-Work Setup:</u> The primary challenge was setting up the design system as part of the pre-work, even before the project officially kicked off. This required laying the groundwork for the design system, including defining its structure, guidelines, and foundational components, to ensure quick adoption and implementation. </li>
					<li><u>Branding and UI Foundation:</u> Establishing the product's branding and envisioning the overall UI were important challenges to address before the project kick-off. The design system needed to incorporate the brand identity and provide a solid foundation for the visual aspects of the user interface, setting the tone for the product's overall look and feel.</li>
					<li><u>Scalability:</u> One of the critical considerations was to ensure that the design system could be seamlessly extended and applied to other internal products.</li>

					<p>To initiate the project, I actively engaged with essential stakeholders, including front-end developers, the product owner, the tech lead, and other executive members closely involved in the project. By gathering requirements and insights from this diverse group, I ensured that the design system would address their specific needs while aligning with Bowlero Corp.'s overarching objectives. 
					<p>
					By actively listening to their input, I gained valuable insights into their unique requirements, pain points, and aspirations. This inclusive approach fostered a sense of ownership and collaboration among the stakeholders, ensuring their buy-in and commitment to the design system's success.
					<p>
					By harmonizing the stakeholders' input with the organizational objectives, I ensured that the design system would facilitate efficient and effective processes, streamline development efforts, and enhance the user experience. This alignment not only guided the development of the design system but also ensured its relevance and value in the context of Bowlero Corp.'s broader strategic initiatives.

				<ul class="wow slideInUp">
					<h3 style="text-decoration: bold;">Key activities:</h3>
				
			
					<ul>
					<li>Conducted some research to understand existing design systems that we can use and researched their best practices.</li>
					<li>Collaborated with stakeholders to define the core values and principles for the design system.</li>

				<ul class="wow slideInUp">
					<h3 style="text-decoration: bold;">Researching Existing Design Systems</h3>
					<p>Conducted thorough research to explore and understand existing design systems that could serve as valuable references. This involved studying established design systems used by other organizations and analyzing their best practices. This research aimed to gain insights into successful design patterns, components, and methodologies that could be applied to our own design system.


</p>
					
				</ul>
</div>
<div class="designmargin">
				<ul class="wow slideInUp">
					<h3 style="text-decoration: bold;">Picking a framework</h3>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Material UI is well-suited for internal tools, making it a reliable choice</li>
					<li>It offers ease of customization through its flexible theming and styling options. This allows us to align the visual appearance of our UI components with our branding and design preferences</li>
					<li>Familiarity also played a role in selecting Material UI3. Both the development team and I have significant experience with the framework, enabling us to work efficiently and deliver results quickly. 
</li>
					<li>Furthermore, migrating our existing systems/products to Material UI3 seemed to require the least effort. One of the products was built using the MUI  tech component system, while another used the ANT system. Migrating from ANT to Material UI appeared to be a less demanding task compared and much more cost-effective compared to other frameworks.

</li>
					<li>Seamless integration with React </li>
				
				</ul>
<p></p><p></p>
				<p>Although ready-to-use web components for Material UI3 were not available or stableat the time of setup, we agreed with the development team to style and customize the MUI components according to the Material UI3 guidelines. </p>
				<p>We opted for Material-UI (MUI) for our new web application due to its seamless integration with React, our chosen development framework. Additionally, MUI's highly customizable theme provided us the flexibility to align the product's UI with Material Design 3. MUI has extensive and well-documented API references for each reusable React component that implement Material Design guidelines. </p>
				<p>This choice is a win-win situation for the design and development teams, enabling us to create a visually appealing and cohesive user interface in a short amount of time.</p>





</p>
</div>
<div class="designmargin">
				<ul class="wow slideInUp">
					<h3 style="text-decoration: bold;">Defining Core Values and Principles</h3>
					<p>Based on the collaborative discussions, established a clear set of core values and principles for the design system. These principles were focused on achieving <u>consistency, usability, and accessibility </u> throughout the user interface. Examples of such principles could include <u>simplicity, clarity, efficiency, responsiveness, and inclusivity.</u> These principles were the foundation for making design decisions and maintaining a cohesive visual language across the design system.


</p>
					
				</ul>
</div>
<div class="designmargin">
				<ul class="wow slideInUp">
					<h3 style="text-decoration: bold;">Creating a Visual Style Guide</h3>
					<p>Developed a comprehensive visual style guide that captured the desired aesthetic and brand identity for the design system and the product/all internal products. This involved defining typography, color palettes, iconography, spacing, layout grids, borders/corners, elevation and other visual elements. The style guide acted as a reference document for designers and developers, ensuring visual consistency and coherence across different components and screens of the design system.

								<p>
While setting up the design system for Bowlero Corp., we faced challenges with limited ready-to-use components in Material-UI v3. We overcame this by customizing existing components and developing new ones. Implementing fluid components for a fluid design approach also required careful consideration, but the team's dedication and collaboration led to a successful outcome, resulting in a comprehensive and scalable design system.</b>
