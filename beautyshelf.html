					<p>I started the project with a thorough research in order to design a beauty inventory app with features and flows that make it delightful for people to use.

I started to read about statistics and trends regarding the beauty industry itself and after I have identified the demographic characteristics of potential target users of BeautyShelf, I focused on collecting data about consumer behaviours.

					<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Competitive Analysis</h3>
					<p>When it comes about competitors, there aren't many beauty inventory apps in the market as of today (2019 September). I <b>analyzed 2 beauty inventory apps and 2 general inventory apps</b> that can be used to track beauty products as well and listed out what strong features they have and identified the ones that could be improved within the app. I was able to understand how I can distinguish our product from the competitors.

					<p>Once I have phrased the HMW questions, I had my starting point of <b>brainstorming possible solutions to solve the core problems of users</b>. Wrote each HMWs down and started to collect as many solutions I could think of. Then I took some extra time and explained in more detail what I thought of exactly. I did not really consider technical constraints at this point whether they would be easily applied to the app or not because I was planning to think about that during crafting my Product Roadmap document.<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TbtGE5q8NY9lF7Zy6cR87lI-br0ynv-F/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" style="color: #16152b;"><span class="highlight"> View my list of ideas</a></span> <p></p>

					<p>Before diving myself into designing the app, I focused on defining the shared goals of BeautyShelf and users to help achieve both business stated and user goals. I identified the shared goals of BeautyShelf and the users in order <b>to make better design decisions</b>. </p>
						<p>Then I laid out a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gBMor_b85dDKaCHg56Mg7iLro4DwY6Tk/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" style="color: #16152b;"><span class="highlight">Product Roadmap document</a></span>, where I prioritized the HMWs and <b>selected features from my brainstorming document</b> that could be best implemented into the app and best solves the problems of Cholette by keeping in mind the shared goals.</p>

					<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Information Architecture: Sitemap</h3>

					<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">User Flow</h3>
					<p><b>To visualize how Cholette (our persona) would navigate through the app</b>, I created a User Flow diagram with two scenarios illustrating her journey. The first scenario showcases how the user would add her own product to the application's inventory by utilizing the camera and scanning the barcode of the product in. The second scenario focuses on her need of finding harfmul chemicals-free beauty products in the database that she can add to her BeautyShelf because she wishes to purchase it soon. This helps me understood which screens should be designed in order to have a delightful experience.

					<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Low-fidelity Sketches</h3>
					<p>Finally, I have arrived to the actual design stage when I started to think about how the app would look like. Before going digital, I quickly sketched out on paper a few main screens with elements and features that I was planning to add to the mid-fidelity wireframes. As I mentioned before, I decided to design for Android because BeautyShelf can fill in the market gap as there are little to no beauty inventory apps available for Android and the demand is pretty high for one! </p>

					<p><b>Based on the low-fidelity sketches</b>, I created mid-fidelity wireframes in Figma, which I could later export to MarvelApp <b>to build my mid-fidelity prototype</b>. I have made quite a lot of changes compared to the sketches as I realized that those layout ideas of my sketches should <b>be simplified</b> in order to avoid confusion in this complex application.

				<p>To save me time and to stay cost-effective, I decided to run usability testings on the mid-fidelity wireframes before designing the user interface of the app. This allowed me <b>to figure out what is needed to be improved on the current design</b> so I could make changes to it in the beginning stages of the design phase. To be able to run testings, I linked my mid-fidelity wireframes together by using hotspots in MarvelApp and the <b>limited functionality prototype</b> was ready to be tested with a few users.

								<h1>Reflection</h1>
								<p>This project put pressure on me in the beginning as I haven't designed a mobile app from start to finish on my own - this is my first one - however I knew that it was going to be fun for me as I am myself a beauty enthusiast. Designing such a complex mobile app was challenging but by relying on my secondary research findings and in-person interview insights, I was able to move from one step to another easily as I had a clear understanding about what potential target users need when it comes to tracking beauty products. </p>

								<li>Keep track of metrics to see the engagement of main features.</li>
								<li>Prepare for hand-off to developers.</li>
